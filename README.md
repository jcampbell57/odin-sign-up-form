# odin-sign-up-form

For this project, I will combine what I have learned so far about HTML and CSS to create a form to sign up for a fake service. I will also include enough javascipt to verify the password upon submit.

Here is the example given to recreate: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png

I anticipate that I will be able to reinforce a lot of basic skills in this project and be able to return to it as a reference for future projects involving forms. 

V2 could be improved by:
- specifying which specific password criteria is invalid within the Custom Validity
